# Kaggle---Hand-drawn-Sketch-Recognition
Assignment of Machine Learning course (COL-774) at IIT Delhi, Spring 2018.

### Problem Statement
In this assignment, we will deal with the problem of identifying an object given its hand-drawn sketch. Most of such data is collected by noting down the sequence of strokes made to draw the sketch. Instead of providing you the raw stroke level data, we are providing you the final image corresponding to each drawing. The data has been obtained from some online sources with some modifications. Your task in this assignment is to predict the object that was drawn given the image of the drawing. The dataset comes from a set of 20 different labels (objects).
